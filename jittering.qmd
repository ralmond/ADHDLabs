title: "Jittering"
---

If our $x$ or $y$ variable only has a few possible values (usually because it is a count), the points in the scatterplot will plot one on top of the other, so it is difficult to tell how many there are.  They will also often be a series of parallel lines, which is just an artifact of the granularity of the data, but it is a very easy feature for our eyes to pick up.

The secret is to add a little bit of noise (random numbers) to $x$ and $y$.  This is called _jittering_.  In this case, both our $x$ and $y$ are integers, so we want to add noise that is less than one.  One way to do this is to add a uniform random varaible in the range $(-.5,.5)$.  Another was is to add a normal random variable with a standard devation between 1/2 and 1/3 (so 95--99\% of the time it will be less than one).

SPSS does not have jittering built in, but we can do by creating new variables with the `Transform > Computer Variable ...` command.  Select the X or Y variable you want to transform and `Rv.Normal` from the list of random number functions.

Now replot the graph using the new jittered variables.  As you can see, the relationship between the variables is much more obvious in the jittered plot.  In particular, there is now a skewness in both $X$ and $Y$ which was not apparent before, and the linear relationship is more apparent.

In some cases, it makes sense to only jitter one of $X$ or $Y$.
