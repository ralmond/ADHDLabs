# Datasets



## ALEC Data

This is the ADHD data gathered by @prevatt15


* [Data (CSV)]('data/ACED-Subset.csv')

* [Codebook]('data/Alec-Subset-Codebook.pdf')

If you get really stuck on the data cleaning, you can email the instructor for an SPSS save file.

## ACED Data

I previously used a data set ACED [@fatHog], which is still used in some examples.

* [ACED (CSV)](data/ACED-Subset.csv)

* [ACED (SAV; SPSS format)](data/ACED-Subset.sav)
