### Predicting Future Observations

<!-- Removed this from L3 to reduce workload. Idea is to polish this body of text into it's own optional section. -->

The last part of the lab requires you to assess how well the model
predicts the general anxiety scores from the hyperactive impulse scores.
To do this, you will need to save predicted values in the regression
dialog. There are several different varieties of predicted values, but
the best one for our purposes is the "Adjusted" predictions. These refit
the model without each value in turn and then use that model to predict
the data point that was left out. For example, the prediction for *617*
is made using all of the data points except *617* in fitting the
regression line.

One of the fundamental rules of statistics is that we should always be
honest about how much we know and how much we don't know. Thus, along
with our prediction, we should say something about the accuracy of our
prediction. Statisticians usually do this by producing an interval
estimate. They pick a probability (usually 95%) and produce an interval
that should contain the actual value with that probability.[^4]

SPSS will calculate both the predicted value and a prediction interval;
however, it offers a choice of two different prediction intervals. This
is because there are two sources of prediction errors. Suppose we were
interested in the mean anxiety score for students who scored exactly 12
on the hyperactivity impulse scale. Our prediction would be the point on
the regression line corresponding to *X* = 12. However, there is some
sampling error in the slope and the intercept, so we have a confidence
interval around where the point should be. This is the "mean" type
prediction interval produced by SPSS.

If we are interested in a particular student with that score, then we
also need to consider the fact that most data points don't lie exactly
on the line. The residual variance gives us the amount of additional
error we need to add to our intervals. The "individual" style intervals
in SPSS add this extra variance. These are the ones that we want.

*Figure 1. SPSS Regression Save... dialog with best choices for this
lab.*

If you set up the "Save..." dialog in SPSS on our regression as shown in
Figure 1, you should get the following four new variables in your data
view:

-   PRE\_1 -- this is the exact value (on the transformed scale if you
    transformed the outcome) predicted by the line.

-   RES\_1 -- this is the residual (difference from the predicted value)
    for each school.

-   LCI\_1 -- lower prediction (confidence) interval for each state.
    This is the lower bound on our uncertainty about the prediction.

-   UCI\_1 -- upper prediction (confidence) interval for each state.
    This is the upper bound on our uncertainty about the prediction.

Each time you run the regression using the "Save..." option, you will
get a new set of residuals and predicted values. SPSS will increment the
number so "\_1" is from the first regression model, "\_2" is from the
second and so on. You probably will want to name the saved variables
IMMEDIATELY after you run each model, or soon you will forget what all
of the saved items are!! Once you have done that, getting the prediction
for a particular student is simple. Just scroll down in the data until
you get to that student\'s row and look across for the PRE\_k (or
ADJ\_k) column (point prediction) and LCI\_k and UCI\_k columns (lower
and upper bounds for confidence interval).
