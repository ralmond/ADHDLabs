If you add text labels to your variables as you create them (you can do this in the transformation dialog) the plots and table will come out with more human readable labels.\nDo I need both histograms and boxplots? The best way to answer this question is to think of your lab report as telling a story. Do the histograms and boxplots tell different stories? If yes, include them both (and explain in the text the interesting observations in both). If no, pick the one that tells the story the best and include only that one.\nIs XXX an outlier I should worry about? Not every point that shows up on the extreme ends of the scatterplot is an outlier. The boxplot has a built-in test for outliers, so that is a good tool for double checking whether something you noted in the scatterplot is an outlier or not. If you suspect outliers, another test you can make is to rerun the regression excluding the potential outliers. To do this, use the command Data > Select Cases… [ALT+D S] and select the “If…” option and write an expression that will exclude the outliers, e.g., “hyper < 35”. Then run the regression or correlation command again.\n\nThe slope and correlation should change a little bit, but not a lot. If they do change a lot, then the outlier is worth mentioning. If they don’t you could give it a passing mention (e.g., “XXX thought to be an outlier, but rerunning the regression with XXX excluded produced only a small change in the correlation and slope.”), but not more. However, if the results change markedly, report both numbers (unless you have a substantial reason for thinking the outlier doesn't belong in the population). It is fairly common for students to go outlier crazy at this point in time, don’t fall into that trap.\nHere are some web sites that cover SPSS and regression that you may find helpful:\nhttp://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/spss/seminars/SPSSGraphics/spssgraph.htm\nhttp://core.ecu.edu/psyc/wuenschk/spss/corrregr-spss.doc"

    "text": "Lab Four\nSPSS gave me a significance of .000, what should I do for the p-value?\nPut down p<.001 (SPSS automatically rounds the p-value to three digits, and so it must be smaller than that, but it is not impossible, so the value is not zero).\nHow do I pick which line of the t-test results to use?\nSPSS provides more information here than you need to report. First, look at Levene’s test (the first couple of columns which appear only in the first row). Is it reasonable to assume that the variances are equal? If so, use the first line of the table. If not, use the second line of the table. Generally you do not need to report Levene’s test, unless you decided to use the unequal variance procedure because of it.\nAnother viable strategy is to ignore Levene’s test, and always use the second row. If the variances are approximately equal both rows are about the same. If the variances are different, then the second row is the one to use anyway.\nWhy doesn’t SPSS supply an effect size?\nI don’t know, but if you wait for IBM to supply one, you won’t get the lab in on time. Haiyan Wu (with some cleanup by Zhongtian Liang) put together an Excel spreadsheet which has the formula in it. This is available at http://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/effectSize_d.xls.\nIf I fix every single thing the TAs mark on my draft lab, will I get a perfect score on the final?\nNo. Often other mistakes become apparent once the first mistakes are fixed. Sometimes we will miss things on the first round and pick them up on the second. This is life in the research world and the same thing often happens with research papers and grant proposals. Get used to it.\nHow come I got a different result from the one in Prevatt et al. (2015)?\nDr. Prevatt did the analysis for that paper a year or two before she shared the data with us (it just takes that long to go through the review processes). Therefore, do not expect the number you get to be exactly the same as those found by Prevatt et al. (2015).\nHave I done all of the required tests?\nYou should have both a one-sample confidence interval and independent (2-sample) t-test. Every time you do a test you need to report the t-value, degrees of freedom, p-value and effect size. You should have done the test with and without the graduate students and you should have graphical support for all of your tests(Knuth, 1984)."

However, the mean is sensitive to outliers, which are commonly found in distributions with high kurtosis, or strong positive or negative skewness.\nThe median is more robust to departures from normality resistant to outliers, but if the data are approximately normally distributed, the standard error of the median is generally bigger than the standard error of the mean.\nThe minimum and maximum, although very useful for data cleaning, are not really useful for describing the location of the data. If there is one or more outliers, chances are it will be the minimum, the maximum or both.\nThe mode is also not a particularly good measure of center. Technically, if all of the values are unique, then they are all modes, so we haven’t reduced the data at all. If there are multiple modes, SPSS just reports the lowest (with a footnote), so real analysts seldom bother with it."

    "text": "Skewness and Kurtosis\nUsually, the best way to judge skewness or kurtosis is graphically (using a histogram or a boxplot). However, SPSS offers a skewness and kurtosis statistic as well.\nA symmetric distribution (like the normal distribution) has a skewness of zero; negative values of the skewness statistic indicate negative skewness; positive values, positive skewness. In practice, a given set of data is rarely perfectly symmetric; a sample from a symmetric distribution will have a non-zero skewness statistic. This is not an issue, unless the skewness is very strong (positive or negative).\nHow strong is a cause for concern? The heuristic I use is to divide the skewness statistic by its standard error (also calculated by SPSS). If the result is bigger than 2 (or less than -2), then I think that skewness may be an issue. Otherwise, I go ahead using normal-theory methods. (By the central limit theorem, if the data are only slightly non-normal, the distribution of the mean will be pretty close to normal.)\nI use a similar heuristic for the kurtosis. The kurtosis statistic is scaled so that the normal distribution has a kurtosis of zero. Only if the kurtosis statistic is bigger than two standard errors do I start to worry. Here, I only worry about high kurtosis (heavy tails) as that means lots of outliers. (High kurtosis slows down the central limit theorem, but low kurtosis is not a problem.)"

    "text": "Graphs at end, versus graphs in text\nIn the 20th century, manuscripts were often typewritten, and figures and tables were submitted on separate sheets. The manuscript would say some like <<FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE>> where they wanted the figure. The publisher was then responsible for adding the figure. Generally the figure should be placed right after the first paragraph of mention. But if there is not enough room, it might “float” to the top of the next page.\nI find it easier to read when figures and tables are in approximately the place that they will be in the final manuscript. While LaTeX does an excellent job of placing Figure and Tables, Microsoft Word (and Libre Office Writer, and Google Docs, and Apple Pages) aren’t quite so good. Especially, as paragraphs expand and contract, the figures may need to be moved for optimal placement. Because the figures can float, it is important to refer to them by number and not using position references like “above” or “below” which could change.\nBe careful with tables. Word, by default, allows tables to split across page boundaries. This makes them harder to read. Unless the table is very long, it should be avoided. There should be an option to keep the table together in the table properties (the location, however, will vary with the word processor and the version of the word processor in use).\nSometimes, publishers in the 21st century still want all the figures at the end of the document. This is not an appendix, it is just the figures or tables. Once again, it is important to refer to them by number as the positions will be set later.\nFor the lab assignment, you may use either approach (but don’t try to mix them, that is just ugly)."

The APA convention is to put captions for figures above the figure and captions for tables below the figure. The caption should be done in the word processor, not SPSS, as the figures and tables may need to be renumbered. Also, the caption should be on the same page with the figure or table (or else it is “widowed”). There is often an option to “keep with next paragraph” in the paragraph dialog.\nFigures and tables are numbered separately, usually with consecutive integers. (Books will sometimes use number of the form chapter.figure, but papers usually use a single number.) Generally figure numbers start with Figure or Fig. and table numbers with Table or Tab. The F or T is capitalized when “figure” or “table” is followed by a number, and it become a proper noun (i.e., it does not take an article like “the” or “a”). If referring to it in the text, it is better to put a non-breaking space between the word and the number, so this does not split across lines. The easiest way to reference a figure or table is to just put (Figure xxx) or (Table yyy) after the sentence where it is referenced. The word “see” is implied and is usually omitted to save space."

When preparing tables and graphs for exploratory use, it is fine to use these abbreviated names. When it come time to prepare the graph or table for publication, be kind to the reader who is often not a member of the research team. The short SPSS variable names should be replaced with longer, human readable names. If there is additional data (such as units) it is often good to put this there as well. So while “Population” is better than “Pop.”, “Population (in thousands)” is better still.\nSPSS provides an easy way to do this: go into the variables view and add a “Label” to each variable. While the variable name is a short and must follow certain conventions (e.g., no spaces) the label can be any descriptive string. SPSS will use labels for axis labels on graphs and column/row labels in tables if it has them.\nAlso, take some time to make the captions on the tables and graphs provide as much information as possible. It should be able to get a good idea of what is in the table while only skimming the text. If there are abbreviations in the table or graph that need explanation, add a footnote to the table."

    "text": "Prevatt et al. (2015) were interested in investigating students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) so that they could teach them strategies to compensate for their difficulties. As sitting for an examination requires sitting quietly for long periods of time (something that persons with ADHD typically have difficulty doing), it would seem to follow that students with ADHD might be more anxious about tests than students without ADHD 1.\n\nThis is a conjecture, however, so the step is to find data to test our hypothesis. Obviously, we cannot perform an experiment—not only would it be unethical to artificially give a person ADHD, we don’t know how to do it. So, the best that can be done is an observational study. Prevatt et al. (2015) have access to students with ADHD who are coming to their clinic (this is the treatment group). They also randomly draw a control sample of students who have not been diagnosed with ADHD. They give both the patients and the control students an academic anxiety instrument.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOnly the control group is randomly selected, the treatment group is a convenience sample, and the “treatment” in this study is a pre-existing condition, not randomly assigned. This makes the study quasi-experimental.\n\n\n\n\nFor the purposes of this lab, we will look at one of the research questions addressed in Prevatt et al. (2015):\n\nIs there a difference in academic anxiety in students with and without ADHD?\n\nAnswering this question relies on two variables present in the question. The first, academic anxiety, is what we’ll measure. The second is our grouping variable—an ADHD diagnosis. To answer our question we’ll need to compare the anxiety scores between the two groups (i.e., t-test) and test whether the difference is meaningful or not (i.e., effect size).\n\n\n\n\nWe’ll use the same Alec data we used in the first lab. Refer to the first lab handout for instructions on reading the data set in. If you saved your data as an SPSS .sav file after the first lab, you can use that instead of reading it in again. If you didn’t save your .sav file from lab one, then you’ll need to download the raw form and clean it again.\nDon’t forget that you need to:\n\nadd human readable labels to the variables,\nadd string values for the nominal and ordinal variables, and\nmake sure the value -9 is coded as missing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe default variable names are all programmers’ codes, and not human readable. You will need to fix this for full style points. (The Lab One handout has more information if you are unclear.)\n\n\nThis data set has lots of missing data. Some of the data are missing at random (e.g., a participant left half-way through), some of those data are structurally missing. In particular, the control students did not have all of the same measures taken about their performance that the ADHD students did.\nWe can use some descriptive statistical analysis to see who is in our data set. In particular, use the below command to compare the sample sizes of the academic anxiety score (genanxa) and something with fairly complete data, like Age, breaking the scores down by control and ADHD groups (put group in the independent variable box).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPSS Command\n\n\n\nAnalyze > Compare Means > Means …\n\n\nWhat do you see?\nLook carefully at the case processing summaries, from which group are most of the cases missing? What does that say about who is included in the sample?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that the SPSS t-test commands will only use complete cases—students who have both anxiety scores (genanxa) and group identifiers (group)—in the analysis.\n\n\n\n\nYou want to repeat some of the exploratory analyses from the first lab on the sample. In particular, you will want to think about comparing the academic anxiety (genanxa) for the two groups of students. What graphical displays could help you with that? What tables might be useful?\n\n\n\n\nLet us start with the question of what the average anxiety level is for all students. We can calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean anxiety score using SPSS’s one sample t-test procedure:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPSS Command\n\n\n\nAnalyze > Compare Means > One Sample T Test….\n\n\n\nThis should open a dialog box like  (which uses numbers from a different example). Move the genanxa variable into place and then press the “Options…” button. Check to make sure that a 95% confidence interval was selected. The press okay a couple of times and your results should appear in the output.\nThe first part of the output tests the proposition that the average anxiety score is zero. The right hand side of the table has our confidence interval for academic anxiety.\n\nFigure 1. One-Sample T Test dialog box\nNote that variables are from a different example.\n\nFigure 2. T Test Options Dialog box\n\n\n\nWe can now do an independent sample t-test to see if the observed difference in anxiety scores between the students with ADHD (Group 1) and the control students (Group 2) conditions can be explained by random differences in the individuals in the group (or other measurement error). We can run an independent sample t-test through:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPSS Command\n\n\n\nAnalyze > Compare Means > Independent-Sample T-Test…\n\n\n\nFigure 3. Independent-Sample T Test dialog box\nAgain, example taken from a different data set.\nFirst, fill in the “Test Variables” with the dependent or outcome variable. In the example (from the in-class portion of the lab), this was the temperature. In your case, it will be the academic anxiety variable (genanxa).\n\nFigure 4. Defining Groups for the T Test\nAgain, your group numbers may differ from the example.\nSecond, fill in the “Grouping Variable” slot with an appropriate value for condition code. First, press Define Groups… to describe the groups. Because the groups are coded with integers, put “1” and “2” into the dialog box. (If you had used strings instead of numbers to code the groups, you would have needed to put the string, for example, “Male” and “Female”, in the box.) When you are done the dialog box will look something like Figure 4.\nPress OK and the t-test results will appear in the output window. It will also produce a table with means and standard deviations and a 95% confidence interval for the mean. (If you want a different level for the confidence interval, you can select that through the Options… button on the t-test dialog.)\n\n\n\nThe last thing we need is an effect size. Unfortunately, SPSS does not seem to calculate the effect size. This isn’t too hard, all we need to do is divide the mean effect (we can find that in either the t-test output or by taking the difference between the means in the means table) by the standard deviation. The only question is which standard deviation.\nUnfortunately, SPSS does not calculate that either. What we want is the pooled standard deviation, which contains information from both the full and accuracy only conditions. We get this by averaging the variance (remember the standard deviations have a square root in them). Properly speaking, we want a weighted average, where the weights are related to the degrees of freedom.\nLet \\(n_{2}\\) be the number of subjects in the control group and let \\(n_{3}\\) be the number of subjects in the ADAD group. Let \\(s_{2}\\) be the standard deviation of the control group and \\(s_{3}\\) be the standard deviation of the ADHD group. We want to weight the variances by the degrees of freedom, that is, the number in the sample minus one. Thus the pooled standard deviation will be:\n\\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\left( n_{2} - 1 \\right)s_{2}^{2} + \\left( n_{3} - 1 \\right)s_{3}^{2}}{n_{2} + n_{3} - 1}}\\)\n\nA former TA, Haiyan Wu (with some cleanup by another TA, Zhongtian Liang), put together an Excel spreadsheet which has the formula in it. This is available at http://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/effectSize_d.xls. To use this spreadsheet, you need to find the means, standard deviations and group sizes and put them in the appropriate cells. This will calculate the effect size.\n\n\n\nAs most of you have probably learned by now, graduate school is somewhat different from undergraduate education. There are 85 graduate students in the data file, but looking at (table_one?), they are underrepresented in the control group compared to the ADHD group. Consequently, we might want to remove them from the analysis to see if that makes a difference.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1 was created using:\nAnalyze > Compare Means > Independent-Sample T-Test…\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 1. Students by year and condition group\n\nTo test if the graduate students make a difference, we can remove them from our analysis. To remove the graduate students and rerun the analysis use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPSS Command\n\n\n\nData > Select Cases…\n\n\nPress the “If …” button and enter the expression\nYear ~= 5 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n~= is the way SPSS expresses not equals, and 5 is the numeric code for graduate students ((codebook?)).\n\n\nDoes removing the graduate students make a big difference in any of the conclusions?\nSometimes, although not with these data, you may need more complicated expressions. You can do this using the “&” (and) and “|” (or) operators. For example to select subject who have condition code 1 or 2 but not level code 6, you would use:\n(Condition_Code = 1 | Condition_Code = 2) & Level_Code ~= 6\nYou also have a choice here. You should not report both the full data numbers and the graduate students removed numbers, rather, you should think of one as primary and the other as secondary. Report the results for one, and then describe the difference when you remove (or add back in) the graduate students. However, think about the problem of which group of students to use as the main and which as the secondary analysis and then pick that one."

    "text": "At the end of this lab you should be able to perform a simple linear regression, including diagnostics and making predictions. The question we’re exploring in this lab is:\n\nCan the impulsivity symptoms be used to predict general anxiety in ADHD patients?\n\nPrevatt et al. (2015) were interested in how the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affect the performance of college students. To study this, they looked at the relationship of the two key symptoms of ADHD, inattention and impulsivity, on measures of both academic and general anxiety. In other words, they were looking for a correlation between the symptoms reported by participants and a measures of academic anxiety. In this lab, we are going to examine the relationship between one symptom, hyperactivity impulsive symptoms (hyper), and the general anxiety measure (GADD).\nTo answer our research question we’ll need to answer the following questions in our analysis:\n\nWhat is the correlation between the hyperactivity impulsive symptoms (hyper) and general anxiety (GADD)?\nCan we use linear regression to predict the anxiety score (GADD) from the impulsivity score (hyper)? What is the prediction line? How much of the variance in the anxiety score can be predicted by the hyperactive impulsive symptoms score?\nIs there any reason to believe that the regression is different for students from different years?\nThere are three students with hyperactive impulsivity scores (hyper) above 30. Do they strongly effect the estimated regression line and/or correlation?\nStudent 617 scored 12 on the hyperactive impulsivity (hyper) scale. What is a 95% prediction interval for his anxiety score (GADD)? Does the student’s score fall within the interval?\n\n\n\nThe data file with the data for this lab can be found in the data library. This is the same data set used in Lab One. Refer to the first lab handout for instructions on reading the data set in.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you saved your data as an SPSS .sav file after the first lab, you can use that instead of reading it in again. If you didn’t save the .sav, you’ll have to download the raw data and clean it again. Always store your raw and cleaned data somewhere safe\n\n\nDon’t forget that you need to:\n\nadd human readable labels to the variables,\nadd string values for the nominal and ordinal variables, and\nmake sure the value -9 is coded as missing.\n\nThis data set has lots of missing data. Some of the data are missing at random, some of those data are structurally missing. In particular, the control students did not have all of the same measures taken about their performance that the ADHD students did. We can use some descriptive statistical analysis to see who is in our data set. As before, use…\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPSS Command\n\n\n\nAnalyze > Compare Means > Means …\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Command Dialog\n\n\n…to compare the sample sizes of the general anxiety score (GADD) and the hyperactive impulse symptoms (hyper) for the control group and the ADHD group1. What do you see? How do the measures differ? Are there any missing values?\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Output from Compare Means\n\n\nThe SPSS scatterplot, correlation and regression commands will only use complete cases—students who have both anxiety and impulsivity scores—in the analysis. What does that say about who is included in the sample?\n\n\n\nWe have already done much of the univariate exploratory analysis of the data in lab one. We will now concentrate on the relationship between hyperactive impulsive symptoms (hyper) and the general anxiety score (GADD). The basic exploratory tool for exploring the relationship between two continuous (i.e., interval or ratio) variables is the scatterplot. The command for building a scatterplot is:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPSS Command\n\n\n\nGraphs > Legacy Dialogs > Scatter/Dot…\n\n\nSelect simple scatterplot from the first window that appears. Place GADD in the x-axis and hyper in the y-axis as shown in Figure 3 and click OK to generate your plot.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Scatterplot Options\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Scatterplot in Output\n\n\n\n\nWe want to check to see if the relationship is linear curved or linear. To do this, double click on the plot to open the Chart Editor. Now we can click on the line icon , this will add a regression line.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Scatterplot with regression line added\n\n\nDo the data look roughly linear?\nRemember, the linear regression will only pick up the linear part of the relationship, not the curve. It’s up to you to ensure that your data is appropriate for the test you’re trying to run. More accurately, however, as a researcher you would want to select the model that is most appropriate for your data. But that’s difficult when you’re learning about your first models.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe also want to check for the presence of outliers in our data. To identify outliers in SPSS click the Data Label Mode icon  in the SPSS Plot Editor to turn your cursor into an identification tool.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Scatterplot with labeled points\n\n\nYou can click on any data point to make its case number appear and disappear. Use this procedure to look for outliers. We are looking for two kinds of points. First, we are looking for points in the extreme range (high or low) of the x-axis which might be highly influential. Second, we are looking for points that are not generally associated with the point cloud.\nIn general there are three things to look for in a scatterplot are:\n\nAre the data linear? Curved? Sort of a round blob?\nAre there any outliers? If so, which points?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we want to check to see if the year in school (YEAR) makes any difference with the relationship we’re interested in exploring. Unless you’re working with a literal vaccum, as this is espeically true for social sciences, there are always going to be other variables that influence the relationship you intend to study. We call these extraneous influences confounding variables. It’s important to check for potential confounders. You do not always have data to check every potential confounding variable, but when we design a study we always try and include important variables that may influence our results (e.g., age, gender, location, etc.).\nTo check whether one of these variables might be influencing on the reltionship we’re studying, we want to use different symbols or colors to represent group membership (i.e., year) in our scatterplot 2. Generate another scatterplot exactly as you did in Figure 3, but this time add YEAR to the “Set Markers by” box in the scatterplot dialogue. This will produce a plot with different colored points to represent which year the person (i.e., point) is in.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Scatterplot marking points by school year\n\n\nAs you can see, the default is to use various colors to denote different groups. However, it’s difficult to see clear patterns when points are grouped tightly together. Let’s change the symbol used for different points in the Chart Editor.\nOpen the Chart Editor by double clicking on the scatterplot in your output window. Once open, double click on any point in the scatterplot to open the marker properties and choose the Variables tab.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Marker properties dialog\n\n\nThe Year in School (YEAR) variable is in the Group row. Under the grouping option you can choose the Style. By default it will show Boarder Color, but we want to click on this option, which should produce a drop-down menu, and select Shape and click Apply.\nNow look at the plot. Do all of the groups follow the same general pattern, or are the groups visibly separate?\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Scatterplot with shapes\n\n\nEven with using shapes it is difficult to see any clear patterns in the main cluster, which can be a good trait depending on your purpose! How about the outliers? Is there a certain group that seems to tend towards a particular area?\nWhen we’re checking for confounding variables, we’re wanting to make sure there is not another varaible (e.g., year in school) that explains a pattern we may or may not see in the scatterplot. Let’s look at one more example by checking whether there is a clear pattern between male and female respondents.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Scatterplot with shapes for male and female\n\n\nThis does show a few points at both the upper and lower end of the x-axis are more male, but those are just a few outliers and not a true clear clustering of two groups.\n\n\n\n\nIt does not appear we have to worry too much about confounding variables—based off the data we have—so let’s move on to correlations. To calculate the correlations, use:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPSS Command\n\n\n\nAnalyze > Correlate > Bivariate…\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Dialog for generating correlations\n\n\nWhat is the correlation between the two scores of interest? Is it weak or strong? Positive or linear?\n\nNormally, APA style would have us report the p-values 3 and the sample sizes along with the correlations. Don’t bother with the p-values, as we haven’t covered them in class yet, but do report the sample sizes. Are the sample sizes different? If so, why? Is that difference likely to affect the outcome?\n\n\n\nLinear regression in SPSS is done through the menu item\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPSS Command\n\n\n\nAnalyze > Regression > Linear…\n\n\nIn this dialog you select the dependent variable and one or more predictor (independent) variables4. You can also add case labels and these will be used in the diagnostic plots. Our question asks whether we can predict the anxiety score (GADD) using the impulsivity score (hyper). Enter GADD as the dependent variable (i.e., the predicted) and hyper as the independent (i.e., predictor) variable.\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Linear regression window\n\n\nThe Statistics… button provides a pop-up dialog in which you can select various statistics about the regression. In particular, you will want confidence intervals5 for the coefficients and model fit statistics.\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Statistics reporting for linear regression\n\n\nThe Plots… button6 provides a pop-up dialog in which you can select plots. Checking “Histogram” will get you a histogram of the residuals7. You can add diagnostic plots using this dialog box. Select a variable for the x-and y-axis and then hit next to get the opportunity to select another plot. The plot that I like best is the residuals versus predicted values. Select *ZPRED (the standardized predicted values) and move this to the x-axis, and select *ZRESID (the standardized residual values) and move this to the y-axis.\n\nThe Save... button provides a pop-up dialog that allows you to save predicted values and residuals. The Unstandardized predicted values are the values you would get if you computed the predicted value using the estimated slope and intercept from the full sample. (Russell also likes the Adjusted predicted values, which are from the regression line that leaves out the point being predicted – you can try these out, to see which are helpful to you.) You will also want a prediction interval for the individual predictions. Finally, saving some kind of residual will allow you to make additional plots. The standardized residuals are the most useful.\n\nThe Options... dialog has options relevant to multiple linear regression and missing values. We don’t need to worry about it.\n\nLook at the output and check the correlation. Is the relationship strong or weak? Is it plausible to believe that there is a linear relationship between the two scores? Are you concerned about any points?\n\n\nOne of the first assumptions of least squares regression is that the residuals are approximately normally distributed. This can be tested with a histogram of the residuals. To do this in SPSS you need to save the residuals (either the raw residuals or the standardized residuals for this test) when doing the regression.\nA problem with the plots generated by SPSS is that if you use Case labels all of the points are labeled. This makes the plot busy and difficulty to read. Turn off the labels as described above then select the cross-hair data labeling mode button. You can now pick out points that look unusual to label. Also, don’t forget to add Labels for your variables. This will give you human readable labels on the x- and y-axes. If you did forget, you can always double click on the axis label in the graph editor to produce a better label.\nThe second assumption is that all of the residuals have approximately the same variance. We can test this with a fitted value versus residual plot. For this we want the standardized residuals and the predicted values. We can either do this from the saved values or we can request it through the regression dialog.\nThe residual versus predicted plot contains a lot of information. First, if any of the residuals is particularly large (or small) we suspect an outlier. Secondly, if we can detect a curved pattern, then that is an indication that the linear regression is not explaining all that is happening. There may be some higher order polynomial effect. Third, we can identify heteroscedasticity (to check the homogeneity of residual variances). This usually results in a triangle shape pattern for the residuals: residuals on the left are larger in magnitude than the ones on the right (or the other way around). If you go on to take EDF 5401 you will learn more about heteroscedasticity and what to do about it.\nIf you detect outliers, you may wish to re-run the analysis without the outliers. If the conclusions are substantially different, you should report both conclusions."

    "text": "This material is optional as it is no longer required, but still may be interesting.\n\nPredicting Future Observations\n\nThe last part of the lab requires you to assess how well the model predicts the general anxiety scores from the hyperactive impulse scores. To do this, you will need to save predicted values in the regression dialog. There are several different varieties of predicted values, but the best one for our purposes is the “Adjusted” predictions. These refit the model without each value in turn and then use that model to predict the data point that was left out. For example, the prediction for 617 is made using all of the data points except 617 in fitting the regression line.\nOne of the fundamental rules of statistics is that we should always be honest about how much we know and how much we don’t know. Thus, along with our prediction, we should say something about the accuracy of our prediction. Statisticians usually do this by producing an interval estimate. They pick a probability (usually 95%) and produce an interval that should contain the actual value with that probability.[^4]\nSPSS will calculate both the predicted value and a prediction interval; however, it offers a choice of two different prediction intervals. This is because there are two sources of prediction errors. Suppose we were interested in the mean anxiety score for students who scored exactly 12 on the hyperactivity impulse scale. Our prediction would be the point on the regression line corresponding to X = 12. However, there is some sampling error in the slope and the intercept, so we have a confidence interval around where the point should be. This is the “mean” type prediction interval produced by SPSS.\nIf we are interested in a particular student with that score, then we also need to consider the fact that most data points don’t lie exactly on the line. The residual variance gives us the amount of additional error we need to add to our intervals. The “individual” style intervals in SPSS add this extra variance. These are the ones that we want.\n\nFigure 1. SPSS Regression Save… dialog with best choices for this lab.\nIf you set up the “Save…” dialog in SPSS on our regression as shown in Figure 1, you should get the following four new variables in your data view:\n\nPRE_1 – this is the exact value (on the transformed scale if you transformed the outcome) predicted by the line.\nRES_1 – this is the residual (difference from the predicted value) for each school.\nLCI_1 – lower prediction (confidence) interval for each state. This is the lower bound on our uncertainty about the prediction.\nUCI_1 – upper prediction (confidence) interval for each state. This is the upper bound on our uncertainty about the prediction.\n\nEach time you run the regression using the “Save…” option, you will get a new set of residuals and predicted values. SPSS will increment the number so “_1” is from the first regression model, “_2” is from the second and so on. You probably will want to name the saved variables IMMEDIATELY after you run each model, or soon you will forget what all of the saved items are!! Once you have done that, getting the prediction for a particular student is simple. Just scroll down in the data until you get to that student's row and look across for the PRE_k (or ADJ_k) column (point prediction) and LCI_k and UCI_k columns (lower and upper bounds for confidence interval)."

    "text": "In the course of four labs, you (working in groups of up to 3 people) are going to write a short paper addressing a question about attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. This will use data collected by Prevatt et al. (2015) and will replicate some of their results.\nTo make this task somewhat more manageable, we will split writing the paper into four parts:\n\nGetting the data into SPSS (or R) and writing descriptions of the data and measures.\nDoing simple summaries, both numerical and graphical of the data.\nLooking at relationship between anxiety and ADHD symptoms using regression.\nLooking at the difference between students referred for ADHD and randomly selected students using a \\(t\\)-test.\n\nAfter each part, you will submit a draft paper, on which we will give you feedback. You will earn participation points only for the drafts. At the end of the course, at least one member of your group will submit a final report. This is the part that will be scored. The Final paper is worth 1/4 of the total grade in the course (weighted equally with both midterm and final).\n\n\n\nThere are several important goals in having you write the paper. First, in many of your future careers, you will need to write summaries of research. So we are going to get you used to writing in academic style. Some of the issue here is that there is a need for more precision in academic writing than in casual speech. For example, if I said to you “Dinotopia is a book about dinosaurs in the library,” I could clue you in with my vocal accents whether it was a book about dinosaurs in the library or a book in the library about dinosaurs (it could be both, Dinotopia does have a scene with dinosaurs in a library).\nSome of the rules of academic language are common to general good writing. There should be one paragraph per topic, and each paragraph should have a topic sentence. Others are related to the need for precision; if you write “We fit the model to the data,” is it clear which model was fit to which data set? Finally, there are technical terms that need to be used in the correct way. For example, “significance” has a very technical meaning in statistics, so using if for it lay meaning of “large and important” implies thing about the support of the data for the claim which you might not mean.\nWriting about data will also help you gain greater depth in your statistical vocabulary. By writing about the data, you learn about what is important to look for when reading other peoples statistics. You will also learn more about how to use the terms. It also helps the teaching staff identify points of confusion you might still have about the some of the statistical terms.\nIn addition to the rules for text, there are rules for figures (plots and graphs) and tables. Each should be given a caption which tells something about it. The rows and columns of the table and the axis of the graph should be human readable names and not the abbreviations often used for variable names in stat packages. You should use the right number of significant digits: too many or two few obscures the relationships you are trying to describe.\nThe grading for the final report will be split with 60% for doing the correct analysis and 40% for having good academic style. I am somewhat flexible here, I don’t insist on exact APA style, but it should be close enough (in particular, if your discipline uses a different style, that is fine). But it is important that everything is clear.\n\n\n\nThis version of the lab handout assumes that you are using SPSS to do the computing. I don’t actually care which statistics package you use. I will try to write alternative instructions for using the free R statistics package; however, you already know Stata or want to write your own code in python, more power to you. I will probably only be able to give you general advice.\nSPSS is menu driven, so is somewhat easier to learn than R (which uses command scripts). SPSS is available in 3 ways:\n\nThe Learning Resource Center (LRC) computer labs in Stone and Tully have a number of computers with SPSS loaded. These can be used unless a class has scheduled the lab. Bring a usb drive to save your files, as these computers are set to erase all of your files when you log out. There is usually somebody at the desk in the LRC who can help with problems logging in and starting SPSS (they may or may not be able to answer SPSS questions).\nFSU has a virtual computer lab at https://its.fsu.edu/service-catalog/desktop-and-mobile-computing/its-software/myfsuvlab (Press the Sign-In button to start). This is supported by the university ITS (The help link is on the same page). If you are having difficulty getting the virtual lab to run on you computer: (1) try a different browser (e.g., chrome instead of firefox) and (2) contact the ITS help line.\nYou could purchase your own version of SPSS (or you might have access on another machine though your work). Note that SPSS licenses are time limited, so this is a rather expensive option.\n\nIn general, doing your computing in person in the LRC will be easier than working remotely through the virtual lab. The latter is sometimes glitchy and performance will depend on how fast your internet connection is. However, I can put up with a fair amount of lag to avoid driving into campus."

If you double clicked on the Alec-5400Subset.csv file, Windows probably opened the file in Excel. Windows will not let you open the file with another program (e.g., SPSS) while it is open in Excel. So close it in Excel before loading it into SPSS.\nVirtual Lab Only. You will need to upload the Alec-5400Subet.csv to the virtual computer. With the virtual computer open, hover the mouse of the hamburger icon in the center top of the virtual lab screen (just above the pointer in the picture).\n\n\n\n\nVirtual Lab Menu Button\n\n\nThe upload icon should appear.\n\n\n\nVirtal Lab Upload Button\n\n\nYou will then get two file chooser dialogs, the first will let you pick the local file on your computer (Alec-5400Subset.csv), the second will ask you where to put it on the remote computer (I would suggest the Documents folder). Remember, when working on the remote machine, the SPSS file dialogs refer to files on the remote machine, not the local one.\nTo read a CSV file, into SPSS version 27 or 28, select File > Import Data > CSV... from the menus. (In the documentation for the beta release, IBM gives File > Import ..., so they might move this in future versions). This will first open a file picker to let you pick your .csv file and then a dialog with a number of options. Check them over to see if you need to change anything, you probably won’t. Select OK and SPSS will try to read the data file. It will put the results in the spreadsheet like variables view which should now open.\nNote that the CSV format is not a standard. Sometimes there are variable names in first line, sometimes not. Sometimes commas, semicolons or tabs are used to delimit values. Sometimes strings are put in single quotes, double quotes or no quotes at all. In Europe, they sometimes use a comma instead of a period for a decimal point. If the data doesn’t look right (in particular, if you have extra columns, or values that just look funky), you probably selected the wrong values. Try the import again until you get it right."

This is useful for remembering what you were doing when you pick the file up again after being away from the project for a while. The Insert menu gives you a number of ways to add comments into the output.\nTo practice, select Insert > New Text, and copy and paste the Prevatt et al. (2015) reference.

    "text": "Adding Metadata\nGo back to the data editor window. Notice on the bottom there are two tabs marked Data and Variables. The data view is the typical spreadsheet view of the data: columns are variables and rows are cases. The variables view gives you the meta-data: the data about the data. You can use the tabs on the bottom or the shortcut Ctrl+T (Cmd+T on Mac OS) to switch between the two views.\n\n\n\nVariable View\n\n\nThe first column gives the Name of the variable. By convention, names need to follow certain conventions (which come from programming languages). They need to start with a letter, they can only contain letters, numbers and a limited number of punctuation marks, they can’t contain embedded spaces, and they can only be so long.\nFor that reason, SPSS also gives a Label to each variable. This should be a human readable label; you could also add important information (for example, instead of “AGE” you can have “Age (in years)”. Entering labels is good documentation practice. It has an added bonus, when making graphs and tables, SPSS uses the labels instead of the cryptic abbreviated names if they are available. This means your graphs and tables are easier to read (Style points!).\nThe Type column tells whether the data are stored as strings or numbers. You usually don’t need to set this. If you have data of type string when you were expecting number, that is usually a sign that something went wrong when the file was read in.\nThe columns width, decimal, columns and align control the appearance of the data in the data view."

SPSS will guess that numeric values are Scale and string variables are nominal. Sometimes you need to fix this.\nThe nominal and ordinal variables in this data set are all integer coded. That means that each number can be mapped onto a longer name. For example, in the Years column, 1=\"Freshman\", 2=\"Sophomore\", and so on. To indicate to SPSS what the value labels are, click in the box in the Values column in the row for the variable we want to enter. You will then see ... (which is code for click on me, I open another dialog). So click on that, and you will see something like this:\n\n\n\nValue Entry Dialog\n\n\nTo add values, type the number in the box marked “Value”, the label in the box marked “Label” and then hit add. You can use this to add the values one by one. If you make a mistake, select the value/label pair from the list, correct the mistake and press “Change.” When you are done, press “OK”.\nWhere do the labels come from? The code book. Look up the variable in the code book, and that will give you the values.\nNext switch back to the data view. You probably will see the numbers, and not the values. Select the item View > Value Labels (there is a little check box beside it to show if it is selected), the labels will now show in the data editor instead of the integer values. Selecting this again will switch them back. You can work in either view (I prefer to see the labels)."

In other cases, the measure might just be optional: some students take the SAT, some the ACT, and some neither test (particularly grad students who may have done their undergrad work in another country). In those cases, we need to mark those data points as missing or NA (not applicable).\nLooking at the code book, the value -9 is used for NA. To tell SPSS how missing values are coded, go to the variable view, and click in the column marked Missing. Click the button marked ... and a dialog like the one below should pop up.\n Select the discrete missing value and enter -9. Hit OK to save. Do this for all of the variables (as they all might have missing values).\nWhy are there multiple possible values? Because there may be more than one kind of missingness. The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) has three different missing codes:\n\nQuestion was skipped\nQuestion was not reached\nMultiple marks or other scanner error.\n\nThese three values can be marked in two ways: they can all be added as discrete missing values, or by selecting range below and entering 7 and 9 in the boxes all values between 7 and 9 would be marked as missing.\nThis can be used to mark out of range values as missing suppose that a variable has legal values from 0 through 10 and that -9 is used as a missing code. This would imply that any value of 11 or above is some kind of data entry error, so should be treated as missing. To mark the out of range values as missing in SPSS, select the “Range” option, and put 11 in the Low box, some large value in the High box, and -9 in the Discrete value box. The result should look something like this:\n\n\n\nMissing Values with range of values\n\n\nDepending on the analysis, you may want to treat those differently (although at a first pass they are all missing)."

A table of descriptive statistics should then appear in the results area.\nLook at the minimums and maximums. Are there any negative numbers? If so, then you have failed to code the missing values for some variables. Go back, fix that and run it again.\nNow check the minimum and maximums against the descriptions of the data in the code book. You will notice that there are some values that are implausibly large or small. What could have gone wrong:\n\nSomebody made a typo when entering data.\nSomebody made a registration error when entering data (this is like a type, but it is when you accidentally skip or duplicate a value, so everything is shifted over by one or more columns).\nSomebody was unclear on how to enter the data\nThe value is unusual but correct (maybe there is a person who is 230 cm tall in the sample).\n\nIn the first three cases, you will want to go back to the original data if you can and fix the error. In this case, we don’t have that luxury, so we just need to mark out of bounds values as missing.\nConsider the SAT data. A number of people have an SAT of 0, which is not a score the College Board ever gives out. So, we can restrict the value for the SAT scores to 200 to 800, which is the legal range. Go back to the missing dialog and using the missing range feature. And mark scores between 0 and 199 as missing. Note we can still mark -9 as the discrete missing value.\nNow check the other variables carefully against the codebook. There are a couple of other data entry problems in these data. Make sure you clean them up before you go on.\nFor the nominal and ordinal values, you will want to use a slightly different command. Use Analyze > Descriptive Statistics > Frequencies.... This time, select only the nominal and ordinal variables (these will have the three circles or three bars icons). You also want APA style tables. The dialog should look like this:\n\n\n\nFrequency Selection\n\n\nWhen you are finished cleaning the data, save it as an .sav file. (If you are on the virtual machine, you will want to copy this down to your local computer). Make sure you stash a copy someplace safe as you will want to get back to them again.\nCongratulations! You have finished the hardest part of the lab! I’m not kidding. Data entry, data cleaning and data management are the hardest parts of data analysis, and certainly the parts that take up most of the time (it gets even harder if you need to merge data from two different sources; many more ways that the process can go wrong)."

If you are not in the school psychology program, you can just put one paragraph of background (summarizing Prevatt, et al. 2015) in the introduction. If you are in the school psych program, expand the background on ADHD a bit (you should be familiar with the readings).\nResearch Question. We will focus on two research questions: (1) exploring the relationship between ADHD symptoms and anxiety and (2) exploring the difference in anxiety levels between students with and without ADHD. Write these out in your own words. (Note, these should be scientific hypotheses, not the statistical null hypothesis; don’t worry about this if you haven’t learned what a null hypothesis is yet).\nMethods: Data Description. This is not your own data collection, but you do need to summarize how (pravatt15?) gathered the data. From where did they come? What are the inclusion and exclusion criteria? How big is the sample: how many ADHD and control students are there.\nMethods: Measures. For each of the measures in the data dictionary, give a brief description. In particular, if this based on a questionnaire, how many questions are there and how are they scored (yes-no? 4-point scale?)\nResults: Data Description. Give some basic descriptive statistics for each variable.\n\nFor nominal and ordinal variables, give the number of students in each category, as well as the number of missing values.

    "text": "Pretend that you are analyzing these results and submitting them as a paper to a journal. You will need to follow general APA style. Your report should have the following sections (you can use different names, but the contents should be there).\n\nIntroduction --- A brief statement of the general problem you are solving and why somebody might care. [I’m doing this because it’s a homework assignment doesn’t count; be creative here.]\nResearch Question/Hypothesis --- A brief statement of what question you are trying to answer and what you expect to find according to your theory. This is the scientific hypothesis and not the null hypothesis. Note that this lab has three research questions: corresponding to Sections 3, 4 and 5.\nData --- A brief description of the data. What was the population and how the data were sampled. [This should not be a click-by-click description of what you did in SPSS, but rather make it sound like a real scientific study.] Don’t forget to cite your source!\nAnalysis --- Some descriptive statistics about the data followed by the results of the formal hypothesis test. You should include a graph and table to highlight what you observed. You should include a test statistic, p-value and effect size. APA style contains recommended method for reporting the results of common tests. Check the APA style guide for the labs on Blackboard.\nConclusions --- Describe what the statistical results mean in terms of the scientific problem posed at the beginning of the report. A significant difference is not you conclusion, but rather evidence that supports your conclusion. Speculate about whether or not you can generalize from the conclusions. Note that the data are NOT a random sample. How does that limit the conclusions?\n\nAs before, you will need to turn in a draft, which will be marked up, followed by a final paper. Check blackboard for the due date. The final is due one week after the initial drafts are marked.\n\n\nDon’t use too many digits in your tables or text. SPSS will cheerfully compute means to 6 decimal places even if the original data only has one or two. Generally speaking, a mean should have one more decimal place than the original data and a standard deviation should have one more decimal place than the mean.\nWhen the experiment compares two different genders special care is needed.1 (My intent is not to preach political correctness here, but rather to make you aware of the general rules for academic writing about sensitive topics, so that your paper won’t get bounced by a politically correct editor.) When speaking about the two different genders use equivalent terms, e.g., “men” and “women”, “male” and “female”, or “boys” and “girls”. Don’t use terms that might be regarded as unequal, e.g., “men” and “girls.” Make sure that you don’t imply that difference in speed makes men better than women, e.g., “The study found that men were better runners than women,” rather than just “The study found that men were better than women.”2 Bear in mind that your subjects are human beings with dignity and worth beyond the few numbers we have gathered about them. That should keep you out of trouble. (Similar rules apply when writing about racial differences or persons with disabilities.)\nFinally, go back to lab one and the style guide and review the pointers on making graphs and naming variables. All of these rules will still apply.\nJiwon (Alice) Nam, a TA for 5400 in Fall of 2010, put together a brief guide to APA style. Take a look at this. You don’t need to follow APA style strictly, but you must have all of the five elements described in Section 8 and they must be easy for the reader to find to get full style points."
