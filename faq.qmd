# Frequently Asked Questions (by lab)

## Lab One

## Lab Two

## Lab Three


1)  *Use variable labels.* If you add text labels to your variables as
    you create them (you can do this in the transformation dialog) the
    plots and table will come out with more human readable labels.

2)  *Do I need both histograms and boxplots?* The best way to answer
    this question is to think of your lab report as telling a story. Do
    the histograms and boxplots tell different stories? If yes, include
    them both (and explain in the text the interesting observations in
    both). If no, pick the one that tells the story the best and include
    only that one.

3)  *Is XXX an outlier I should worry about?* Not every point that shows
    up on the extreme ends of the scatterplot is an outlier. The boxplot
    has a built-in test for outliers, so that is a good tool for double
    checking whether something you noted in the scatterplot is an
    outlier or not. If you suspect outliers, another test you can make
    is to rerun the regression excluding the potential outliers. To do
    this, use the command [D]{.underline}ata \> [S]{.underline}elect
    Cases... \[ALT+DÂ S\] and select the "If..." option and write an
    expression that will exclude the outliers, e.g., "hyper \< 35". Then
    run the regression or correlation command again.

The slope and correlation should change a little bit, but not a lot. If
they do change a lot, then the outlier is worth mentioning. If they
don't you could give it a passing mention (e.g., "XXX thought to be an
outlier, but rerunning the regression with XXX excluded produced only a
small change in the correlation and slope."), but not more. However, if
the results change markedly, report both numbers (unless you have a
substantial reason for thinking the outlier doesn\'t belong in the
population). It is fairly common for students to go outlier crazy at
this point in time, don't fall into that trap.

*Here are some web sites that cover SPSS and regression that you may
find helpful:*

## Lab Four

*SPSS gave me a significance of .000, what should I do for the*
p*-value?*

Put down *p\<.001* (SPSS automatically rounds the *p-*value to three
digits, and so it must be smaller than that, but it is not impossible,
so the value is not zero).

*How do I pick which line of the t-test results to use?*

SPSS provides more information here than you need to report. First, look
at Levene's test (the first couple of columns which appear only in the
first row). Is it reasonable to assume that the variances are equal? If
so, use the first line of the table. If not, use the second line of the
table. Generally you do not need to report Levene's test, unless you
decided to use the unequal variance procedure because of it.

Another viable strategy is to ignore Levene's test, and always use the
second row. If the variances are approximately equal both rows are about
the same. If the variances are different, then the second row is the one
to use anyway.

*Why doesn't SPSS supply an effect size?*

I don't know, but if you wait for IBM to supply one, you won't get the
lab in on time. Haiyan Wu (with some cleanup by Zhongtian Liang) put
together an Excel spreadsheet which has the formula in it. This is
available at
[[http://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/effectSize\_d.xls]{.underline}](http://pluto.coe.fsu.edu/effectSize_d.xls).

*If I fix every single thing the TAs mark on my draft lab, will I get a
perfect score on the final?*

No. Often other mistakes become apparent once the first mistakes are
fixed. Sometimes we will miss things on the first round and pick them up
on the second. This is life in the research world and the same thing
often happens with research papers and grant proposals. Get used to it.

*How come I got a different result from the one in Prevatt et al.
(2015)?*

Dr. Prevatt did the analysis for that paper a year or two before she
shared the data with us (it just takes that long to go through the
review processes). Therefore, do not expect the number you get to be
exactly the same as those found by Prevatt et al. (2015).

*Have I done all of the required tests?*

You should have both a one-sample confidence interval and independent
(2-sample) *t*-test. Every time you do a test you need to report the
*t-*value, degrees of freedom, *p*-value and effect size. You should
have done the test with and without the graduate students and you should
have graphical support for all of your tests[@knuth84].
