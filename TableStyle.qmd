title: "Making Stylish Tables"
---

The default tables in SPSS are good enough for draft quality work, e.g., sharing results with your research group.  However, if they are to be included in a publication, there are some things that can be done to make them easier to read.

## Question 1:  Is this table necessary?

Tables take up a lot of space.  So for every table ask "What is the table add to the story told in the paper?"  Many tables generated by SPSS (e.g., case processing summaries residual statistics) are not really that interesting, so just drop them.  A handy rule is that if you are not going to reference the table in the text, don't include it.  _Every table should have a caption, a number and should be referenced in the text._

Other tables in SPSS have many rows and columns that are just not necessary.  For example, consider the t-test tables in Figure @fig-ttable.  The group statistics are somewhat interesting, so maybe include that table.  But from the next table, only two of the rows are interesting, and there are a bunch of columns that are needed.  Rather than include that table, I would simply include the APA summary in the text using the five marked numbers.

One other issue that sometimes comes up in a study with lots of factors is that these tables can become very large.  Think about how big tables can be broken up into smaller ones which highlight the interesting findings.  The complete tables can be put in the appendix.

## APA Style

Older versions of SPSS had just ugly tables.  They had solid black lines separating the cells which make the table harder to read.  The modern ones are not so bad, the shading for the row labels is useful and the lines between the cells are a less prominent gray.  This is consistent with more modern ideas of graphical design.

APA style (aka Academic Style) has lines at the top and bottom and separating the column labels from the data.  You can change the way SPSS formats the tables in two ways.

### Method 1.  Fix for just one table.

Double click on the table in the SPSS output.  This will open the "Pivot Table Report" window which has a menu.  Select "Table Looks" from the "Format" menu.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
#### SPSS Command

(On the Pivot Table Report window)

F[o]{.underline}mat \> Table Looks...

<!-- find shortcut for this. -->
:::

This opens a "TableLooks" dialog which can be used to set the style of the table (Figure @fig-TableLooks).  The `Academic`, `APA_SanSerif` and `APS_TimesRoma` options all produce APA-style tables.

### Method 2.  Set global option.

SPSS can be set to use a certain table format by default.  First open the options:

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
#### SPSS Command

[E]{.underline}dit \> Optio[n]{.underline}s...
:::

This will pop up a window to edit options, select the "Tables" tab and then "APA" or "Academic" style tables from the list (Figure @fig-TableOptions).

### Method 3.  Do it by hand.

Copy the table contents into a spreadsheet (e.g., Excel) and do any desired edits.

Copy from the spreadsheet into your word processor (e.g., Word) and do more formatting.

This method takes longer but gives you complete control.

## Table Layout

There are a number of ways a table can be laid out.  In particular, the "Compare Means" table is less than ideal.  Consider the table in @fig-pivotBefore.  To compare the mean temperature or heart rate between men and women, the reader's eye must skip over 3 lines.  Swapping rows and columns.  Once again, double click on the table to open the "Pivot Table Report".  In the local menu select "Pivot \> Pivoting Trays...".  The "Pivoting Trays" dialog will pop up.

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
### SPSS Command

(On the Pivot Table Report window)

[P]{.underline}ivot \> Pivoting Trays...

<!-- find shortcut for this. -->
:::



![Compare Means before pivoting](img/PivotTableBefore.png){#fig-pivotBefore}

Dragging the name of a factor from the rows to columns will control where that factor is displayed.  The order determins which goes first and which goes second.  Play around until you get the layout you like.

## Digits

By default, SPSS uses too many digits for my taste.  Extra digits are just noise:  Who cares about a person's annual salary to the nearest penny?  The extra digits give an impression of spurious precision and make the reader's job harder.

My rule of thumb for digits is as follows:  Means/Median should use one more significant digit than the raw data, Standard Deviations/Errors should use two more.  Probabilities should use 2 or three digits, depending.

| Measure     | Data | Mean  | SD     |
+-------------+------+-------+--------+
| Temperature | xx.x | xx.xx | xx.xxx |
| Heart Rate  | xx   | xx.x  | xx.xx  |
+-------------+------+-------+--------+

The digits can be adjusted in the "Pivot Table Report" (double click on the table).  Select the entries to be adjusted and press the increase/decrease digits button.  (@fig-digits).

Most spreadsheets have similar controls.  The number of digits can also be manually edited in a word processor (if the contents are included an not a picture).

## Split Tables and Widowed Captions

A personal pet peeves is tables which split across a page boundary.  Many word processors (e.g., Microsoft Word and Libre-Office Write) allow splitting tables by default.  In my opinion, the only time this is acceptable is when the table is so long it will not fit on a single page.

A related issue is that a table (or figure) can get separated from its caption.  (In the world of typesetting, this is called a "widowed" or "orphaned" caption.)  Section headers should also appear on the same page as the first line of text in the section.

In most word processors, you can right click on a table and/or paragraph and select a "keep together", "keep with next" or "keep with previous" options.  (The names and how to find them are slightly different in different word processors that they can be found.)

A figure or table should go immediately after the paragraph of first mention.  If there is not room on the current page it should "float" to the top of the next page.  If the figure or table does float, then if there is a lot of blank space at the bottom of the page, some of text on the next page can be moved up.

Unfortunately, the most commonly used word processors do not provide good support for this.  [TeX and LaTeX handle this correctly, but learning to use them is a bit of an investment.]  As the optimal layout can change when text is added or deleted, don't worry too much about this until the final couple of passes.

### Figures and Tables at the end

In antemillenial days, when manuscripts were typed on a typewriter and not a word processor, authors would instead of putting the figures and tables in the text, would write 

:::{.center}
`<<< Table XXX about here >>>`
:::
where the figure or table should go.  Then the figures and tables would be supplied at the end of the document, each on a separate page.  This custom persisted into the days of word processors.  Some journals still have this on their submission instructions.

My personal preference is to have the figures and tables in the approximately correct places for the copy of an article that is sent for review.  Often, if it is accepted for publication, the publisher will request the figures and tables in a separate document.

If you choose to use this style.  Simply put the figures and tables at the end.  In the text, refer to them as "Figure X" and "Table Y", this is not an appendix, it is just where the figures are.  An appendix is for supplementary figures and tables which provide more detail than in the main body of text.
